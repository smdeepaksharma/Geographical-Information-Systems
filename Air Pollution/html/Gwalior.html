	<h1 style='color: Blue; font-family: Times New Roman' align='center'>Gwalior</h1>
	<p align='justify' style='font-family: Verdana;'>The Central
		Pollution Control Board's data puts Gwalior at the very top of India's
		eleven most polluted cities in terms of particulate matter. According
		to the pollution control board (CPCB), the particulate matter in
		Gwalior stands at 329 micrograms per cubic metre, which is nearly five
		times the permissible limit of 70 micrograms. The spurt in particulate
		matter pollution may have been caused due to factors such as high
		population density, increase in the number of vehicles, less greenery,
		and dilapidated roads. Gwalior's proximity to Delhi and other cities
		may have also played a role in some way.The rise in population is due
		to the large number of small industrial units that have sprouted up
		within city limits. Such industrial plants add pollutants to the air,
		and need to be moved out of Gwalior. Vehicular pollution contributed
		the most to the particulate matter in the air. It is not just the
		emissions, rather when vehicles ply on dilapidated roads in hot
		conditions, they kick up a lot of dust and particulate matter. The
		reduction in green cover both inside and around Gwalior isn't helping
		either.</p>
