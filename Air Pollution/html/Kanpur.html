	<p align='justify' style='font-family:Verdana;'>Increasing levels of air pollution is once again
		making its presence felt in Kanpur, the largest city in Uttar Pradesh
		thanks to a major contribution from the industries. According to the
		national summary report on air quality monitoring, emission inventory
		and source apportionment study for Indian cities of the Ministry of
		Environment and Forest, Kanpur registered increase in air pollution
		levels due to particulate matter. The report is based on the
		monitoring done at six cities -- Delhi, Mumbai, Kanpur, Pune, Chennai
		and Bangalore. Under the project, 7 to 10 monitoring stations with one
		at background and two each in residential, traffic,
		industrial/commercial locations were selected in each city. At least
		20 to 30 days of monitoring was done for each of the three seasons;
		summer, post/pre-monsoon and winter. The report said that at Kanpur
		and Delhi, almost at all locations and in all seasons, standards of
		Particulate Matter (finer particles) have exceeded except for
		industrial area. In terms of particulate matter pollution, Kanpur and
		Delhi showed highest air pollution levels. Among the major causes of
		air pollution in Kanpur are industrial sector, vehicles, road dust and
		domestic cooking. The industrial sector is the biggest cause of air
		pollution in Kanpur (out of all the six cities) due to presence of
		many small scale industries. The report has made a projection that if
		no action is taken to reduce PM10 and NOx (various oxides of nitrogen)
		emissions, in 2012, entire city will reel under high air pollution.
		The report has recommended some of the ways to control air pollution
		in Kanpur like implementation of BS-VI norms, CNG/LPG for commercial
		vehicles, banning of 15-year-old private vehicles, particulate control
		systems in industry, domestic use of natural gas/LPG, converting
		unpaved roads to paved roads, sweeping and watering (mechanised) and
		strict ban on open burning. The ambient air quality is being monitored
		under National Ambient Air Monitoring Program (NAPM), co-ordinated by
		the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in over 115 cities, which
		also includes the six project cities. On the basis of analysis of air
		quality status and trends upto 2006 in the six cities, except Chennai,
		annual Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) count exceeded
		in all cities. Kanpur showed highest concentration of RSPM, which was
		three times more than the safety standard. RSPM is the most important
		pollution parameter in urban environment.</p>
