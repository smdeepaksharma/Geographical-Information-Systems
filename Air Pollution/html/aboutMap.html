	<h1 align="center">Air Pollution In India</h1>

	<hr />

	<h4 style='font: 13px Times New Roman;' align='justify'>The map
		shows the cities in India with worst Particulate Matter (PM) levels.
		This air pollution map shows the un-healthiest cities in India. The
		World Health Organization (WHO) maintains an Urban Air Pollution
		Database which includes annual average concentrations for PM10 and
		PM2.5, calculated from daily measurements. PM10 includes particulates
		less than 10 micrometers in diameter, while PM2.5 refers to particles
		less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. The WHO has health-based
		guidelines for annual average PM exposure, which are provided as a
		reference for countries seeking to set air standards. According to the
		guidelines, cities can be classified into various levels based on the
		amount (in micrograms per cubic meter) of PM. In the project I intend
		to use Level 1, which is of 70 micrograms per cubic meter for PM10 and
		35 micrograms per cubic meter for PM2.5. On the PM10 map,
		concentrations range from 71 to 329 (according to the database values)
		micrograms per cubic meter and in the PM2.5 map concentrations range
		from 35 to 176 micrograms per cubic meter. Yellow, orange and red
		colored solid circles will be used to indicate the PM level
		concentrations of a city, where the lowest concentration will be
		indicated in yellow and the highest in red.</h4>
