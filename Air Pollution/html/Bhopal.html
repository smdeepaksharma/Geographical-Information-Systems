	<p align='justify' style='font-family:Verdana;'>Main reasons for pollution in the state capital
		are construction of new roads, increase in number of vehicles, overall
		sewerage not being treated, density of habitation and emission more
		than prescribed standards by some industries. According to MPPCB's
		report (as quoted), amount of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter
		(RSPM) in November, 2015, in Govindpura area was found to be
		approximately 10 times higher (476 microgram per cubic) than standard
		World Health Organization (WHO) limits (50 micrograms per cubic meter
		over a period of 24 hours). Similarly, it was nine times higher in
		Hamidia area and four times in Kolar area of the city. Ironically,
		MPPCB headquarter at Paryavaran Parisar recorded RSPM 12.3 times
		greater (616 micro gram per cubic meter) than the WHO limit. Even
		Micro Particulate Matter (PM2.5) was found to be many times higher in
		all five sampling stations. Maximum pollution was found at Hamidia
		area, 11 times greater (270 micro gram per cubic meter) than the WHO
		limit for PM2.5 (25 micrograms per cubic meter over a period of 24
		hours). PM2.5 at Paryavaran Parisar, Govindpura and Kolar areas were
		found approximately eight times more than standard, which is again a
		serious cause of concern, petition said. Besides, hazardous gases like
		nitrogen and sulphur oxides (NOX and SO2) are also more than the
		prescribed limits in Kolar and Mandideep areas. Latest Comment Again

		Meanwhile, AQI of Paryavaran Parisar and AKVN office in Mandideep
		industrial area was 332 and 353, respectively in June last year, as
		per CPCB report. Report points out that AQI of more than 300 can lead
		to respiratory illness in people on prolonged exposure.</p>
