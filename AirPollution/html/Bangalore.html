	<p align='justify' style='font-family: Verdana;'>Bangalore
		generates 2500 tonnes of solid waste every day, and this waste is
		often disposed off in a very unscientific manner. And this worsens the
		situation in the polluted 'garden city'. Once upon a time, walkers in
		the famous Cubbon Park and Lal Bagh used to enjoy the fresh air during
		their walks. Today, a majority of them are forced to wear pollution
		masks during their morning and evening walks. Rapid industrialisation
		and a surge in the number of vehicles have made this once beautiful
		city explode into metropolitan nightmare. Bengaluru is no longer the
		namma Bengaluru that it used to be. Thanks to the unscientific
		disposal of waste, pollution levels have risen to unprecedented levels
		in Bangalore. Experts point out that apart from the industrial and
		vehicular pollution, the waste disposal management by hospitals too is
		in a pitiable condition. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board
		has found that several industries and hospitals do not have a proper
		solid waste management system. So how do these industries and
		hospitals get rid of their waste? They dump hazardous waste into
		landfill sites and even water bodies. Incidentally, India generates
		1.2 million tonnes of solid waste everyday, of which only 60 per cent
		is recycled. Apart from the pollution caused by industries, the rising
		levels of vehicular pollution is also a cause of concern in Bangalore.
		Currently, 26 lakh vehicles ply on the narrow roads of Bangalore; 21
		lakh are two and three wheelers while the rest are four wheelers.
		Today, in namma Bengaluru, air and water pollution levels are at an
		all time high. There is no denying the fact that Bangalore has made
		its mark on the world map thanks to the software boom. However, this
		has come at a high price.</p>
