	<h1 style='color: Blue;font-family:Times New Roman' align='center'>Delhi</h1>
	<p align='justify' style='font-family:Verdana;'>The air quality in Delhi, the capital of India,
		according to a WHO survey of 1600 world cities, is the worst of any
		major city in the world. Air pollution in India is estimated to kill
		1.5 million people every year; it is the fifth largest killer in
		India. India has the world's highest death rate from chronic
		respiratory diseases and asthma, according to the WHO. In Delhi, poor
		quality air damages irreversibly the lungs of 2.2 million or 50
		percent of all children. In November 2016, in an event known as the
		Great smog of Delhi, the air pollution spiked far beyond acceptable
		levels. According to some reports, 80 per cent of PM2.5 air pollution
		is caused by vehicular traffic, though other reports suggest the
		percentage is lower. Other causes include wood-burning fires, fires on
		agricultural land, exhaust from diesel generators, dust from
		construction sites, and burning garbage and illegal industrial
		activities in Delhi. The Badarpur Thermal Power Station, a coal-fired
		power plant built in 1973, is another major source of air pollution in
		Delhi.</p>
	<h3 style='color: blue'>Effects of Poor air quality</h3>
	<h3>Effects on children</h3>
	<p align='justify' style='font-family:Verdana;'>2.2 million children in Delhi have irreversible
		lung damage due to the poor quality of the air. In addition, research
		shows that pollution can lower children’s intelligence quotient and
		increase the risks of autism, epilepsy, diabetes and even adult-onset
		diseases like multiple sclerosis.</p>

	<h3>Effects on adults</h3>
	<p align='justify' style='font-family:Verdana;'>Poor air quality is a cause of reduced lung
		capacity, headaches, sore throats, coughs, fatigue, and early death.</p>
